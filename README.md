# Walmart - Reminder Service

The Reminder service project allows users to:
*	Add a reminder
*	Update a reminder
*	View reminders by Due Date and/or Status.  Leaving Due Date and Status blank will return all reminders.

## Getting Started

Pull down this project and issue a "mvn clean install" to build WalmartProject.war in /target.

Of course WalmartProject.war was uploaded in the event you don't want to have to build it yourself.
Deploy to servlet container.  I used Tomcat 7.

IDE if you want to look at and build the code.  (I used Eclipse)

Or you can build on the command line using Maven (I used 3.3.9)

### Installing

Pull down WalmartProject.war and deploy to servlet container, or pull down project and build and deploy.
